# MazeGen Neue

[MazeGen](https://github.com/radian-software/MazeGen) was a cool
project, but it was also a bit of a mess. This repository was an
attempt to reimplement it in a more extensible fashion. Unfortunately,
I think it kind of turned into [Enterprise
FizzBuzz](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition),
and I eventually abandoned the project. So you should just refer to
[MazeGen](https://github.com/radian-software/MazeGen).
